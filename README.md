Platform to estimate watts of solar panels needed in a solar farm
The solar farm estimator project you developed with Python and Visual Studio Code was an innovative and practical initiative designed to simplify the process of designing solar power systems. The primary goal was to create a tool that could accurately estimate the number and capacity of solar panels required to meet the energy needs of a building or a solar farm. This project also served as a valuable educational experience for your students, allowing them to apply electrical engineering concepts in a real-world context while developing their programming skills.

At the core of the project were several key components. Users could input energy consumption data, such as daily or monthly energy use, or peak power demand. The estimator also included specifications for different types of solar panels, such as power ratings, efficiency, and cost, allowing users to select the most suitable option for their needs. The mathematical models within the tool would then calculate the number of panels required by dividing the total energy needed by the energy production per panel. Additionally, the tool could be upgraded cost estimates based on the selected solar panels and other necessary components, such as inverters and batteries.

To implement the project, I used various Python libraries. For data handling and calculations, libraries like NumPy and Pandas would have been essential. Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn could have been used to create graphs showing how energy production varies with different numbers of panels or locations. If the tool featured a graphical user interface (GUI), libraries like Tkinter or PyQt might have been employed to create an intuitive user interface. The project was probably developed iteratively, with models and interfaces refined based on testing and feedback.

This project had significant educational and practical outcomes. It provided my students with hands-on experience in applying electrical engineering principles in a practical setting, honing their skills in Python programming, data analysis, and software development. The final product was not just an academic exercise but a practical tool that could be used by solar developers or homeowners considering solar panel installations. The project also laid the groundwork for further development, such as integrating real-time data, optimizing for cost or space constraints, or expanding to include battery storage and grid integration.

Overall, this project highlighted my ability to bridge theory and practice, guiding students through a complex, interdisciplinary challenge while creating a valuable tool for the renewable energy sector.
